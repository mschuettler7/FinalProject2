	Raisa Cohen loved her job. For almost a decade, she donned her judge’s robes every morning to serve in New York’s Federal Plaza immigration court, hoping to make a difference for asylum seekers that begin lining up at 4am outside. Since moving to private practice, Cohen still receives thank-you letters from people whom she granted relief. 

</p>

<p>
	Cohen believes her background as an immigrant from Uzbekistan, and work experience representing asylum seekers, made her the judge she was. 
</p>

<p>
	“From an immigrant to an immigration judge was quite a rewarding career,” Cohen said. 
</p>
		
	<p>
	The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University has stored decades of immigration-related data, including the average asylum denial rate of every immigration judge in the country. According to the data from TRAC, an asylum seeker’s chances remain heavily dependent on which judge is randomly assigned to their case.
	</p>
	
		<p>
	Across the 55 sitting judges currently serving in New York, there’s an 89.4 percentage point gap between their asylum denial rates. For Andy Schoenholtz, a researcher at Georgetown University, this gap in denial rates makes immigration court a game of chance - “Refugee Roulette”. 
		</p>

			<p>
			“For legal systems that want to think of themselves as rule of law systems, where what really matters is the law itself and an unbiased application of the law – this is disturbing,” Schoenholtz said.
</p>
<p>
				Attorneys, judges, and academics maintain that legal representation is the single most important factor in an asylum case, but agree immigration judges have incredible power to determine people's fate. 
			</p>

			<p>

			 “I would say 25 % is based on the facts, 25 % is based on the law, and 50 % is going to be based on your judge,” Ramon Guerra, a New York immigration attorney, often tells his clients. 

			</p>

				Unlike other courts in New York, immigration courts fall under the Department of Justice. Judges are meant to abide by an immigration court handbook, but rules on what evidence is required or what the precedents exist are up to the Department of Justice and are constantly changing, says Guerra. During the previous Trump administration, the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/eoir/page/file/1070866/dl"> the Department of Justice removed precedent</a>  that granted asylum to people who had experienced domestic violence. The precedent was eventually reinstated by the Biden administration, but could be removed again. 

			</p>

			<p>
	“Litigating an immigration court is like litigating in the Wild West sometimes. You're just like, well, we'll see the rules when we get there,” Guerra said. 
	</p>
	
		<p>
	In the murky legal environment of immigration court, a judge’s discretion is paramount. Guerra recently represented a survivor of domestic violence, who fled with her daughter to the United States, fearing for their lives. Guerra felt the details of the case guaranteed the woman asylum. Instead, the judge issued a 25-page ruling questioning whether she was persecuted because of her gender and if she was really in danger, since she was able to escape. 
		</p>

			<p>
		Other than appealing the case, there isn’t an accountability mechanism for lawyers to fight what they see as an unfair ruling. Appealing can also cost an asylum seeker money and time, dragging the court proceedings out over years. Lawyers can file formal complaints if they believe a judge has been discriminatory, but they rarely yield any results. 
</p>
<p>
				“What it translates into is judges having enormous power with very little, if any, accountability,” Guerra said. 
			</p>
			<p>

			A judge’s decision is influenced by a number of factors, but Guerra and Cohen both agree that previous work experience seems to be the most important. Among sitting judges in New York who were previously persecutors for ICE, the average denial rate between 2019 and 2024 was 38.1 per cent. For those who used to represent immigrants, the average was 20.3. 

			</p>

					<p>
Cohen’s last published denial rate was 13.3 per cent. She believes this low average is because of her ability to navigate cultural differences, a skill learned during her time working for a legal aid organisation. 
	</p>
	
		<p>
	“I think that was the most impactful in terms of building that true passion for justice and fairness,” Cohen said. 
		</p>

			<p>
		When a Tibetan asylum seeker described their rape in Cohen’s courtroom, she didn’t to take their stoic demeanour as a reason to deny their case. Cohen isn’t sure if other judges understand cultural differences when it comes to emotional expression. 
</p>
<p>
				Individual judges bring their own set of biases to any case, which researchers like Schoenholtz first proved was correlated with their individual denial rate. In 2007, Schoenholtz and his colleagues published a landmark study that proved professional background, race, and gender influence how judges rule. They transformed how people understood the courts, but little has been done to demand accountability. 
			</p>
			<p>

		The average denial rate in New York’s immigration court has continued to grow, along with the gap between judges. The standard deviation of denial rates, a value that indicates the dispersal of data, rose 30.8 per cent between 2011 and 2024. 

			</p>


					<p>
But changes in denial rates cannot be attributed to judges and their differing backgrounds, Cohen says. Cohen was hired during former President Obama’s administration and adjudicated during the first administration of President Trump and former President Biden. In the times of transition Cohen noticed a marked shift in the strategy of ICE prosecutors. 
	</p>
	
		<p>
	“The fact pattern (of the asylum cases) stays the same, it's just that the mindset of the prosecutor changes, and it's the political climate that affects their directives and their priorities,” Cohen said. 
		</p>

			<p>
		In 2023, 10 times more asylum seekers were processed through immigration courts across the country compared with  2008, a year after Schoenholtz’s study was published. Today, there are over 100 million more refugees in the world than 20 years ago, according to UN data. 
</p>

					The pressure is mounting on judges in a backlogged system to handle the influx of asylum seekers across the country. 

</p>
<p>
		“As much as we want to believe that this is an objective judicial system, it's not,” Cohen said. “I long ago accepted it as a fact.”
